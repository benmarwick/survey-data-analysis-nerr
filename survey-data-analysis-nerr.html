<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This survey aimed to collect feedback from diverse stakeholders to help guide management of the cultural resources at the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTM NERR) for the next 100 years. This survey is part of the project ‘From Past to Present: Ecosystem Services and People of the Guana Peninsula’, directed by Sarah Miller. The aim of the project is to better understand how people have utilized and expressed value for ecosystem services historically, how they continue to use them today, and how they can respond to the threats these resources are facing through 2100. The goals of the survey were:</p>
<ul>
<li>To understand community connections and uses of sites and the landscape</li>
<li>To understand community aspirations for the future given the potential impacts from climate change and development.</li>
</ul>

<p>As seen in <a href="#fig-activities">Figure&nbsp;6</a>, the most common activity for that respondents report doing at the GTM Research Reserve is walking, at 31. The next most frequent activity is hiking, with 26 respondents self-reporting partaking in this activity. More general recreational activities like walking, hiking, and general nature appreciation are more dominant than more specific recreational activities like visiting the beach, photography, bird watching, paddling, exercising, biking, fishing and dog walking. Research is the most dominant non-recreational activity, at 16 survey respondents. Research, General Historic Resources Appreciation, Educational Programming, and Volunteering are non-recreational activities that are clustered together with between 16 and 11 individuals reporting participation in them.</p>

<p>As we can see in <a href="#fig-cultural-familiarity">Figure&nbsp;7</a>, all survey respondents were familiar with the Spanish colonist culture, the Timucua culture, the British colonist culture, and the Seminole culture. More than thirty visitors were familiar with the Spanish colonist culture, as well as with the Timucua culture, and Gullah Geechee culture. Survey respondents were least familiar with the Guale culture, and the ancestral period native cultures.</p>

<p>In <strong>?@fig-cultural-resources</strong>, we can see that all survey respondents are at least moderately familiar with the shipwrecks and historic cemeteries, as none report being “not familiar at all” with these cultural resources. Around fourteen people report being very familiar with the wells. More than fiften people are only slightly familiar with the canals in the area. Respondents are most unfamiliar with the remains of industrial activity, shell rings, as well as ship hards, docks, and wharves. Less than five respondents report being unfamiliar with mounds, canals, “slave” cabins, Spanish missions, remains of agricultural activity, shell middens, and plantations.</p>

Almost twenty respondents report that they have never encountered plantations, ship hards, docks, and wharves, or shipwrecks each, at the reserve. Shell Middens are the most frequently encountered cultural resource at the GTM Research Reserve, with more than fifteen respondents. Respondents are most unsure as to whether or not they have encountered shell rings at the GTM Research reserve. We can also see that respondents report encountering wells with some level of frequency, more encountering them overall than not.</p>

<p>Respondents overwhelmingly report that they have noticed increased coastal erosion at the GTM research reserve, at more than 25, as seen in <a href="#fig-effects-climate-change">Figure&nbsp;10</a>. Changes in seasonality, a high water table, and species shifts or extinctions are less prominently noticed at the reserve. Other more noticeable effects of climate change are increased and intensified storm events, increased flooding events, increasing temperatures, and increasing frequency or severity of storms, with more than fifteen respondents reporting that they notice or have experienced these effects a lot at the reserve.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-threat-cultural">Figure&nbsp;11</a>, we can see that respondents percieve sea level rise as a major threat to the cultural resources at the reserve, more than ten respondents ranking it as the top threat to cultural resources. Increasing and intensified storm events are clustered around higher degrees of the threat to cultural resources, at six or higher. Notably, almost fifteen respondents rank flooding as the third most threatening effect of climate change to the reserve. Development is also ranked as the top threat to resources by more than ten survey respondents. Overuse, infrastructure, and management issues are perceived as less threatening by survey respondents. Noticeably, aside from development, climate change related threats, including sea level rise, increased and intensified storm events, and flooding, are ranked by most survey respondents as the greatest threats to the reserve.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-age-activity">Figure&nbsp;12</a>, we can observe that all survey respondents who walk their dogs while visiting the reserve fall within the age range of 40-49. As we saw in <a href="#fig-activities">Figure&nbsp;6</a>, the most common activities among survey respondents included walking, hiking, and general nature appreciation, with more than twenty respondents reporting partaking in each of these activities. In <a href="#fig-age-activity">Figure&nbsp;12</a>, we can see overlap. The most common activities involving respondents distributed across each of seven out of the eight age ranges, are walking, general nature appreciation, and general historic resources appreciation. Research is also among these in <a href="#fig-age-activity">Figure&nbsp;12</a>, with seven out of the eight age ranges partaking in this activity while at GTM. The activity undertaken in the greatest proportion for the 18-29 age range is general resources appreciation, comprising one quarter of those who participate in that activity. Notably, at the most numerous age range, including ten respondents, individuals ranging between 60-69 comprise varying proportion of every activity, except dog walking.

Two or fewer respondents in this age range report familiarity with canals and the remains of industrial activity at the reserve. The least number of respondents across the age ranges report familiarity with the cultural resource of canals. Six respondents in the 30-39 age range report that they are familiar with shell middens and historic cemeteries. Respondents in the ages 70-79 and 80 or older do not report awareness of historic cemeteries, the remains of agricultural activity, shipwrecks, or the remains of industrial activity. Five respondents between 40-49 report familiarity with wells, and four in this range report familiarity with “Slave” cabins, shell rings, Spanish missions, shell middens, historic cemeteries, and plantations. Four respondents ages 50-59 report familiarity with mounds and “Slave” cabins. There are respondents in higher numbers across all ranges who are familiar with mounds and shell middens, whereas few respondents of any age range report familiarity with ship hards, docks, and wharves, the remains of agricultural activitity, and the remains of industrial activity, and canals.</p>

Similarly, 5 respondents ages 60-69 report encountering shell middens, 4 respondents in the age range 30-39, and three or fewer in each of the remaining age ranges report encountering middens. Five respondents ages 60-69 also report encountering the remains of agricultural activitity. No respondents in the age 18-29 report encountering historic cemeteries. Five respondents aged 30-39 report encountering wells at the GTM. One respondent belonging to the 18-29, one to 30-39, one to 40-49, and one to the 70-79 age range report encountering “Slave” cabins.

<p>In <a href="#fig-ethnicity-encountered-cult-res">Figure&nbsp;20</a>, we can see that multi-racial respondents in their greatest proportion report encountering plantations at the GTM. Asian/Pacific islander respondents in their greatest proportions report encountering “Slave” cabins, SPanish Missions, and the Remains of industrial activities. No Asian/pacific islander respondents report encountering historic cemeteries at the GTM. No African-American respondents report encountering shell middens at the GTM. African-American respondents report encountering Spanish missions, the remains of industrial activity, and “Slave” cabins in roughly equal proportion. Caucasion (non-Hispanic) respondents comprise the greatest proportion of respondents by demographic who report encountering shell middens.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-gender-encountered-cult-res">Figure&nbsp;21</a> , respondents who report encountering “Slave” cabins are fewest uniformly across gender. Respondents who identify as female comprise the greatest number of survey respondents as seen in <a href="#fig-gender-identity">Figure&nbsp;3</a>. Encounters with shell middens are uniformly high across gender. The greatest number of respondents who preferred not to say their gender report that they have encountered shell middens at the GTM, whilst none in this group report encountering historic cemeteries. Fewer than five respondents who identify as male report encountering ship hards, docks, and wharves, historic cemeteries, Spanish missions, “Slave” cabins, and remains of industrial activity at the GTM research reserve. More than five respondents who identify as male report encountering wells, remains of agricultural activity, canals, and shell middens at the GTM research reserve. More Fifteen or more respondents who identify as female report encountering wells and shell middens at the GTM research reserve, and just under 15 report encountering the remains of agricultural activity.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-age-threat">Figure&nbsp;22</a> we can see that respondents from all age groups rank sea level rise as the most threatening, or among the most threatening to cultural resources at the GTM. Similarly, respondents across all ages tend to rank climate related concerns like flooding, increased and intensified storm events as among the most threatening to the cultural resources at the reserve. Respondents between 18-29 and 50-59 tend to rank infrastructure (e.g.&nbsp;construction of roads) in the latter two thirds of the threat to cultural resources at the reserve. Similarly respondents across the age ranges rank management issues, and overuse as concerns that are less threatening to cultural resources. Notably, concerns about overuse are the most stratified in the 60-69 age range, with respondents ranking this concern as 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 6th-9th most threating to cultural resources at the reserve. There is similar stratification in this age range for infrastructure, tending to cluster in the 1st-4th most threatening concern for this age group.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-ethnicity-threat">Figure&nbsp;23</a> we can see that respondents who identify as African-American do not rank sea level rise, flooding, increased and intensified storm events, or wave action as the 1st or greatest threat to cultural resources at the GTM. African-American respondents ranked infrastructure (e.g.&nbsp;construction of roads), and “other” are the ranked as the most threatening. Development is the 2nd or 3rd greatest threat to the cultural resources for some African-American respondents in this demographic, whilst other African-American respondents rank increased and intensified storm events as the most threatening. Multi-racial respondents ranked development, management issues, and overuse as the most threating to cultural resources at the GTM. The rankings of individuals who identify as Caucasian (non-Hispanic) are the most stratified across threat level for each of the plots (with the exception of “Other (please describe)”) because, as seen in <a href="#fig-ethnicity-plot">Figure&nbsp;2</a>, survey respondents are the most numerous in this demographic. No respondents who identify as non-Caucasian ranked flooding, increased and intensified storm events, or development as belonging in the lower third (7th-9th) or least threatening to cultural resources.</p>

Similarly, no respondents of any gender rank increased and intensified storm events as less threaning than the 6th most threatening to cultural resources at the reserve. Female and male respondents tend to group climate related threats as more highly threatening to cultural resources, whereas overuse and management issues tend to be ranked as less threatening to cultural resources at the reserve.

<p>In <a href="#fig-edu-threat">Figure&nbsp;25</a>, respondents who have degrees assign stratified and individualized rankings across the given list of potential threats to the cultural resources at the reserve. Interestingly, there are respondents with degrees, with no degrees, or “other” who all rank increased and intensified storm events in the top two thirds (1-6) of their most threatening issues to the cultural resources at the reserve. Individuals without degrees also rank sea level rise and wave action amongst their top two threats to cultural resources at the reserve. Individuals without degrees rank infrastructure, overuse, and management issues as less threatening to cultural resources at the reserve.</p>
